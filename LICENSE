2. The Software, including any derivative works or modifications thereof, shall  
   not be used to generate, display, embed, incorporate, distribute, or otherwise  
   facilitate any form of advertisement, commercial promotion, marketing content,  
   or intrusive personal data tracking mechanisms. This prohibition includes, but is not  
   limited to, the use of banner advertisements, pop-up ads, pop-under ads,  
   interstitial ads, video ads, sponsored content, affiliate links, third-party ad  
   scripts, and any non-consensual or invasive tracking technologies such as

   trackers) integrated within or alongside the Software or its output, whether  
   deployed on websites, applications, or any other medium.

   Exception:  
   Privacy-respecting analytics tools (e.g., Plausible, Umami, or self-hosted systems)  
   that do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) — such as IP addresses,  
   geolocation data, device fingerprints, or behavioral profiles — are permitted only if:  
     - They are opt-in only and disabled by default, meaning they will not function unless the user explicitly enables them,  
     - They are used solely for non-commercial and non-promotional purposes, such as  
       aggregate usage statistics, performance monitoring, or debugging, and  
     - No collected data is shared with third parties or used for advertising, targeting, or profiling.
